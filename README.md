# Node rules for Bazel [alpha]

## Rules

- [npm_packages](#npm_packages)
- [npm_binary](#npm_binary)

## Overview

If you're not already familiar with [Bazel](https://bazel.build), install it first.

These Node rules for Bazel are separate from the [official Google
implementation](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs).

The main differences are:

- Easier setup ([literally four lines](examples/simple/WORKSPACE)).
- No need for a `node_modules` directory.
- You must specify a `yarn.lock` along with `package.json`.

As of 2 May 2018, these rules are extremely limited and only meant to be used
along with [TypeScript rules](https://github.com/zenclabs/bazel-typescript).
However, we're working on bringing them up to the same level of support.

## Installation

First, install [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).

Next, create a `WORKSPACE` file in your project root containing:

```python
git_repository(
  name = "bazel_node",
  remote = "https://github.com/zenclabs/bazel-node.git",
  tag = "0.0.1", # check for the latest tag when you install
)
```

## Rules

### npm_packages

```python
npm_packages(name, package_json, yarn_lock)
```

Used to define NPM dependencies. Bazel will download the packages in its own internal directory.

      <td>
        <p>A yarn.lock file (required).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### npm_binary

```python
npm_binary(install, binary)
```

Used to invoke an NPM binary (from `node_modules/.bin/[binary]`).

  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td><code>install</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>An <code>npm_packages</code> target (required).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>binary</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The name of the binary to execute (required).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
